    I am a Blockchain/Software/Game developer but I consider myself a generalist as I can do pretty much anything. I got involved with blockchain since 2017 and have been working for several prominent blockchain projects. I co-founded several blockchain companies with varying levels of success and have gained management experience as well. I'm a big advocate for privacy and decentralization and I believe that blockchain is the future, assuming this industry can still be saved.
