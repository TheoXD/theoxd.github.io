title: "Interactive Music Gallery"
description: "This is probably a first project I've made for someone else. It's an interactive gallery that scrolls through images. When someone is playing a piano (connected to a MIDI interface) the music stops and images react to the music. It was projected onto a building in a city center. Was made in a small engine called BlendElf."
