To be completely honest with you all, I was never a big fan of blogging. I feel like one of those gossip girls from high school always on their phones, but if todays journalists can do it I figured so could I.

I'm not sure what I'll be writing about, but I'm certain some of you will find my rants interesting. I'm a big fan of blockchain technology, at least I was until it became completely overrun by crypto bros and suits, so I'll probably write quite a lot about my frustration with this industry and where I think it's heading.

Being a developer myself, expect me to write about my experiences with different languages, technologies and frameworks. Currently I'm working on several different projects and plan to revisit my old projects as well.
