In the previous part we've written a Solidity grammar, or at least we've written enough to parse our example contract. Today we'll go one step further and make it actually run by writing our own stack-based virtual machine.
If you somehow missed the previous tutorial - you can download the source code from [here](https://github.com/TheoXD/tinysol/archive/6ecf74c8afef3e4bf90a81a312d91bdda923995f.zip).
This part will involve a lot of Rust, but I'll gradually introduce new Rust concepts for those who are new to the language so that anyone reading it can follow along.

# Stack

EVM is a **stack based** virtual machine. It means that all operations occur on the stack data structure. While queues are FIFO (first in first out), stacks are LIFO (last in first out). If you don't know what a queue is, you've probably been in one.


In essence EVM stack is just an array of unsigned 256bit integers sometimes referred to as `words`. The stack is limited to 1024 words in total with 32 bytes each, so that's a limit of 32 MB.
Since Rust doesn't natively support 256bit integers, we'll use the `ethnum` crate. Let's add it to our dependency:
```toml
[dependencies]
ethnum = "1.3.2"
```

Create a new module `tinyvm.rs` inside our `src/` folder and import the U256 type as well as types from our grammar:
```rust
use ethnum::U256;
use crate::solidity::grammar::*;
```

And our newly created module to our `main.rs`:
```rust
pub mod solidity;
pub mod tinyvm; // <--- Add this
use crate::tinyvm::*; // <--- Add this
```

Now go back to our newly created `tinyvm.rs` module and declare a struct that will hold our stack:
```rust
pub struct Stack {
    stackarr: [U256; 1024],
    top: usize,
}
```

All we need now is to implement some of the most common stack operations, like `push`, `pop` and `swap`, as all stacks share those in common. EVM in particular has multiple push operations, 32 in fact, but since we're dealing with booleans we won't need the entire range of opcodes and just need `push1` and `push` for now.
```rust
impl Stack {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            stackarr: [U256::ZERO; 1024],
            top: 0,
        }
    }

    pub fn push32(&mut self, value: U256) {
        if self.top < 1024 {
            self.stackarr[self.top] = value;
            self.top += 1;
        }
    }

    pub fn push1(&mut self, value: u8) {
        self.push32(U256::from(value));
    }

    pub fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<U256> {
        if self.top == 0 {
            None
        } else {
            self.top -= 1;
            Some(self.stackarr[self.top])
        }   //no semicolon in Rust means this expression is returned, 
            //and it will return either None or Some() depending on the condition
    }

    pub fn swap(&mut self) {
        self.stackarr.swap(self.top - 1, self.top - 2);
    }
}
```
> **Note**
> Rust doesn't have inheritance or prototypes like in other object oriented programming languages. Instead it has traits that allow us to extend functionality of any type, including built-in ones. Also note the lack of semicolons and lack of `return` keyword, as in Rust you don't need to explicitly return a value from a function.

Both `push` and `pop` are pretty self explanatory. `push` adds one element on top of the stack while `pop` removes the top most element of the stack. `swap` swaps the two top most elements.

EVM has over 140 opcodes, but in order to run our little contract we'd only need a small subset of those. Let's also declare some of the OPcodes we're actually going to use:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum OP {
    PUSH32(U256),
    PUSH1(u8),
    POP,
    DUP1,
    SWAP1,
    SLOAD,
    SSTORE,
    ISZERO,
    RETURN,
}
```

# Storage

In order to store state variables we need contract storage. It's simply an array of unsigned 256bit integers where each state variable is stored in a separate slot, so our state variable would be stored at slot 0 (or index 0).
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
pub struct ContractStorage {
    slots: Vec<U256>,
}
```

SLOAD and SSTORE OPcodes will be used to read and write to this storage.

# Tiny Virtual Machine

A virtual machine is something that steps through each OPcode and evaluates them. Our VM just needs a stack, a program to execute, a program counter and calldata.
Calldata is an immutable storage type that contains the function name and arguments passed to that function as raw bytes, where the first 4 bytes are the function signature. For now we're going to assume that our calldata only contains function signature.
```rust
pub struct VM<'a> {
    pub stack: Stack,
    program: Vec<OP>,
    pc: usize,
    calldata: &'a [u8],
}
```

It's implementation looks like this:
```rust
impl<'a> VM<'a> {
    pub fn new(program: Vec<OP>, calldata: &'a [u8]) -> Self {
        Self {
            stack: Stack::new(),
            program,
            pc: 0,
            calldata: calldata,
        }
    }

    pub fn run(&mut self, storage: ContractStorage) -> ContractStorage {
        let mut storage = storage;
        while self.pc < self.program.len() {
            match self.program[self.pc] {
                OP::PUSH32(word) => todo!(),
                OP::PUSH1(value) => todo!(),
                OP::POP => todo!(),
                OP::DUP1 => todo!(),
                OP::SWAP1 => todo!(),
                OP::SLOAD => todo!(),
                OP::SSTORE => todo!(),
                OP::RETURN => todo!(),
                OP::ISZERO => todo!(),
            }
        };
        storage
    }
}
```
> **Note**
> You're probably wondering what the heck are `<'a>`, `&'a` and `<'_>`. That's a lifetime with arbitrary name `a` that we created for our calldata byte array, we're basically telling the Rust compiler that this data should live as long as our VM instance lives. No need to manually allocate/deallocate memory.
> todo!() is a macro that will result in our program panicing when called. It's useful for prototyping as we'll know if we forgot to implement something while still allowing us to compile and run.

Here we iterate over the instruction set and use Rust's pattern matching syntax to match each instruction. Kinda like switch case expression in other languages but way more powerful.
For every new VM instance we pass it a set of instructions to execute as an argument, and when we run it we pass it a `ContractStorage` to execute on, returning modified contract storage.

Now let's implement the OPcodes:
```rust
                OP::PUSH32(word) => {
                    self.stack.push32(word);
                    self.pc += 1;
                },
                OP::PUSH1(value) => {
                    self.stack.push1(value);
                    self.pc += 1;
                },
                OP::POP => {
                    self.stack.pop();
                    self.pc += 1;
                },
                OP::SWAP1 => {
                    self.stack.swap();
                    self.pc += 1;
                },
                OP::DUP1 => {
                    let top = self.stack.pop().unwrap();
                    self.stack.push32(top);
                    self.stack.push32(top);
                    self.pc += 1;
                },
```



```rust
                OP::SLOAD => {
                    let key = self.stack.pop().unwrap();
                    let val = storage.slots[key.as_usize()];
                    self.stack.push32(val);
                    self.pc += 1;
                },
                OP::SSTORE => {
                    let key = self.stack.pop().unwrap();
                    let val = self.stack.pop().unwrap();
                    storage.slots[key.as_usize()] = val;
                    self.pc += 1;
                },
```
SLOAD loads a state variable from storage with top most element as key.
SSTORE stores a state variable to storage with top most element as key and second top most element as value.

```rust
                OP::RETURN => {
                    self.pc += 1;
                    break;
                },
```
RETURN OPCode stops the program execution and breaks the loop.
```rust
                OP::ISZERO => {
                    let top = self.stack.pop().unwrap();

                    if top == U256::ZERO {
                        self.stack.push32(U256::ONE);
                    } else {
                        self.stack.push32(U256::ZERO);
                    }
                    self.pc += 1;
                },
```
ISZERO OPCode looks at the top most element of the stack and replaces it with either 1 or 0 depending on whether it's zero or not, so it flips the value.

Now what we're missing is an instruction set to run and a way to interact with our VM.

# Putting it all together

Start by adding these two structs and these two enums to our `tinyvm.rs` module:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Default, Clone)]
pub struct Contract {
    pub name: String,
    pub functions: HashMap<String, Function>,
    pub variable_map: HashMap<String, usize>,
    pub storage: ContractStorage,
}

impl Contract {
    pub fn new(name: String) -> Self {
        Self {
            name,
            ..Contract::default()
        }
    }
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
pub struct Function {
    program: Vec<OP>,
    pub visibility: FuncVisibility,
    pub mutability: FuncMutability,
    pub returns: Vec<Parameter>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
pub enum FuncVisibility {
    Public,
    Private,
    #[default]
    Internal,
    External,
}
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
pub enum FuncMutability {
    Constant,
    #[default]
    NonPayable,
    Payable,
    View,
    Pure,
}
```
> **Note**
> Enum variants annotated with #[default] will become default values unless explicitly set.

Here we've created a `Contract` struct to hold our contract data, and a `Function` struct to hold our instructions as well as function attributes.
You might also want to import `HashMap` at the top of the file:
```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
```

> **Note**
> `HashMap` is a simple KV key-value store allowing us to map strings to data.

Remember when in the previous part we've written a parser that generates an AST tree? It's about time we used it for something, so we'll use that parsed data to walk the tree and search for relevant contract data. 
Start by implementing a public function `create_contracts`:
```rust
pub fn create_contracts(source_unit: SourceUnit) -> Vec<Contract> {
    handle_source_unit(source_unit)
}

fn handle_source_unit(source_unit: SourceUnit) -> Vec<Contract> {
    //TODO: Iterate over source_unit.parts
}
```

Your programming instincts are probably telling you to use a for loop here, but no.

```rust
fn handle_source_unit(source_unit: SourceUnit) -> Vec<Contract> {
    source_unit.parts.iter().map(|part| handle_source_unit_part(part.clone())).flatten().collect::<Vec<Contract>>()
}

fn handle_source_unit_part(part: SourceUnitPart) -> Option<Contract> {
    todo!()
}
```
Rust encourages a different approach to iteration "the functional programming way" with the help of `combinators`. Let's break it down:
* `.iter()` returns an iterator over the elements of a collection
* `.map()` transforms each element of the iterator. Map takes in a closure (kinda like a lambda function), for example `|num| num * 2` returns value doubled.
* `.flatten()` flattens the iterator of iterators into a single iterator, so instead of ending up with `Vec<Vec<Contract>>` we'll end up with `Vec<Contract>`
* `.collect()` collects the iterator into a `Vec<Contract>` collection

So you simply chain them together to transform your data the way you want it.

You can even skip the .map().flatten() and reduce amount of calls by just using .flat_map() instead:
```rust
fn handle_source_unit(source_unit: SourceUnit) -> Vec<Contract> {
    source_unit.parts.iter().flat_map(|part| handle_source_unit_part(part.clone())).collect::<Vec<Contract>>()
}

```
> **Note**
> We have to clone() the part because we're passing it by value. Cloning is a rather cheap operation in Rust (at least for small structs) and compiler can optimize it away if it's not needed, so clone away!

Now we need to handle SourceUnitPart that holds our contract definition. If we find one - we instantiate a new `Contract`, handle functions and state variables inside the contract and return the contract instance.
```rust
fn handle_source_unit_part(part: SourceUnitPart) -> Option<Contract> {
    match part {
        SourceUnitPart::ContractDefinition(_, name, _, parts, _) => {
            let mut contract = Contract::new(name);
            let _ = parts.iter().map(|part| handle_contract_part(part.clone(), &mut contract)).collect::<Vec<_>>();
            Some(contract)
        },
        _ => None,
    }
}

fn handle_contract_part(part: ContractPart, contract: &mut Contract) {
    match part {
        ContractPart::FunctionDefinition(_, name, params, attr_list, ret_params, _, statement, _) => {
            todo!()
        },
        ContractPart::VariableDefinition(ty, visibility, name, _) => {
            todo!()
        },
        ContractPart::ConstructorDefinition(_, params, attr_list, _, statement, _) => {
            //TODO
        }
    }
}
```
> **Note**
> &mut allows us to pass a mutable reference to a function, so that we can modify contract instance inside the function.

Let's first take care of state variables since they're the low hanging fruit. All we do is insert the state variable into contract's variable map where we keep track which variable belongs to which slot.
```rust
        ContractPart::VariableDefinition(ty, visibility, name, _) => {
            contract.variable_map.insert(name, contract.variable_map.len());
            contract.storage.slots.push(U256::ZERO);
        },
```

Next we have functions.
```rust
fn handle_contract_part(part: ContractPart, contract: &mut Contract) {
    match part {
        ContractPart::FunctionDefinition(_, name, params, attr_list, ret_params, _, statement, _) => {
            if let Some(statement) = statement {
                //TODO: handle function arguments

                let program = handle_statement(statement, contract);
                
                let (visibility, mutability) = handle_attrs(attr_list.clone());
                
                let mut returns = vec![];
                if let Some(FunctionReturnParams::ParameterList(_, ParameterList::Param(_, Some(ret_param), _))) = ret_params.clone() {
                    returns = vec![ret_param];
                }

                contract.functions.insert(
                    find_function_signature(name.clone(), params.clone()),
                    Function {
                        program: program,
                        visibility: visibility,
                        mutability: mutability,
                        returns: returns,
                        ..Function::default()
                    }
                );
            }
        },
        ContractPart::VariableDef...
    }
}

fn handle_attrs(attr_list: Vec<Option<FunctionAttribute>>) -> (FuncVisibility, FuncMutability) {
    todo!()
}

fn handle_statement(statement: Statement, contract: &mut Contract) -> Vec<OP> {
    vec![] //TODO: handle statements and expressions next
}

fn find_function_signature(name: String, params: ParameterList) -> String {
    let mut params_str = "";

    if let ParameterList::Param((), Some(p), ()) = params {
        params_str = match p.ty {
            Expression::Type(Type::Bool(_)) => "bool",
            _ => "",
        };
    }

    format!("{}({})", name, params_str)
}

pub fn get_func_sig(in_str: String) -> String {
    in_str
}
```
> **Note**
> The `"if let"` is a handy Rust syntactic sugar to quickly match on a single match arm.

Now to handle function attributes we simply iterate over the list of attributes and check whether they're private, view, etc. 
```rust
fn handle_attrs(attr_list: Vec<Option<FunctionAttribute>>) -> (FuncVisibility, FuncMutability) {
    let mut visibility = FuncVisibility::default();
    let mut mutability = FuncMutability::default();

    attr_list.iter().for_each(|attr| {
        if let Some(attr) = attr {
            match attr {
                FunctionAttribute::Visibility(v) => {
                    visibility = match v {
                        Visibility::Public(_) => FuncVisibility::Public,
                        Visibility::Private(_) => FuncVisibility::Private,
                        Visibility::Internal(_) => FuncVisibility::Internal,
                        Visibility::External(_) => FuncVisibility::External,
                    }
                },
                FunctionAttribute::Mutability(m) => {
                    mutability = match m {
                        Mutability::Constant(_) => FuncMutability::Constant,
                        Mutability::Payable(_) => FuncMutability::Payable,
                        Mutability::View(_) => FuncMutability::View,
                        Mutability::Pure(_) => FuncMutability::Pure,
                    }
                },
            }
        }
    });
    (visibility, mutability)
}
```

# Calling functions

So far we've built each individual piece of our VM, but we still need a way to interact with it. We do so by giving it calldata.

Let's implement a `call` function on `Contract` that takes calldata as hex and returns a a tuple containing a new modified contract and return the top most value from the stack:
```rust
impl Contract {
    pub fn new(name: String) -> Self {
        Self {
            name,
            ..Contract::default()
        }
    }
    
    pub fn call(&self, calldata: &str) -> (Contract, Vec<Expression>) {
        match self.functions.get(&calldata.to_string()) {
            Some(function) => {
                let mut vm = VM::new(function.program.clone(), calldata.as_bytes());
                let new_storage = vm.run(self.storage.clone());
        
                //Read return values from stack
                let mut ret: Vec<Expression> = vec![];
                function.returns.iter().for_each(|param| {
                    if let Some(r) = vm.stack.pop() {
                        match param {
                            Parameter { ty: Expression::Type(Type::Bool(_)), .. } => {
                                    ret.push(Expression::BoolLiteral(r == U256::ONE));
                            },
                            _ => {},
                        }
                    }
                });
        
                (Contract {
                    storage: if let FuncMutability::View | FuncMutability::Pure = function.mutability { self.storage.clone() } else { new_storage },
                    ..self.clone()
                }, ret)
            }
            None => {
                return (self.clone(), vec![]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Calling functions by hash

In EVM you have to call functions by their signature hash. Add a new dependency to our Cargo.toml:
```toml
keccak-hash = "0.10.0"
```

Now import the hash function at the top of `tinyvm.rs`:

```rust
use keccak_hash::{keccak};
```

```rust
fn find_function_signature(name: String, params: ParameterList) -> String {
    ...
    //format!("{}({})", name, params_str)
    get_func_sig(format!("{}({})", name, params_str))  // <-- Add this
}

pub fn get_func_sig(in_str: String) -> String {
    keccak(in_str.as_bytes())[..4].to_vec().iter().map(|b| format!("{:02x}", b)).collect::<String>() // <-- Add this
}
```

Don't relax just yet, as our contract functions do not contain any OPcodes still. To fix that we have to handle statements and expressions found inside function body.

# Statements and Expressions

To make our functions actually do anything we need to handle statements and expressions.
```rust
fn handle_statement(statement: Statement, contract: &mut Contract) -> Vec<OP> {
    match statement {
        Statement::Expression(expr, _) => {
            handle_expression(expr, contract)
        },
        Statement::Return(_, expr, _) => {
            match expr {
                Some(expr) => [handle_expression(expr, contract), vec![OP::RETURN]].concat(),
                None => vec![OP::RETURN],
            }
        },
    }
}

fn handle_expression(expr: Expression, contract: &mut Contract) -> Vec<OP> {
    todo!()
}
```
The idea is pretty simple, if we encounter a `return` statement we add a `RETURN` OPCode, if we encounter an expression we pass it to another handler.

Now for the final piece of the puzzle, handling of expressions:
```rust
fn handle_expression(expr: Expression, contract: &mut Contract) -> Vec<OP> {
    match expr {
        Expression::BoolLiteral(val) => {
            vec![]
        },
        Expression::Variable(identifier) => {
            let mut slot = 0;
            if let Some(found) = contract.variable_map.get(&identifier.name.clone()) {
                slot = *found;
            }

            vec![
                OP::PUSH1(slot as u8),
                OP::SLOAD
            ]
        },
        Expression::Assign(left, _, right) => {
            if let Expression::Variable(identifier) = *left {
                let mut slot = 0;
                if let Some(found) = contract.variable_map.get(&identifier.name.clone()) {
                    slot = *found;
                }
                [handle_expression(*right, contract),
                vec![OP::PUSH1(slot as u8), OP::SSTORE]].concat()
            } else {
                vec![]
            }
        },
        Expression::Not(_, expr) => {
            [handle_expression(*expr, contract), vec![OP::ISZERO]].concat()
        },
        Expression::Type(ty) => {
            match ty {
                Type::Bool(_) => vec![], //TODO
                _ => vec![],
            }
        },
    }
}
```

Assuming you have been following the steps correctly, you should now have a working VM that can toggle our state variable. Let's test whether we're able to toggle the state variable by creating a new unit test:

```rust
    #[test]
    fn test_call_flipper_contract_flip() {
        let code = std::fs::read_to_string("./contracts/flipper.sol").expect("Unable to read source file");
        let parsed = parse(code.as_str());
        println!("{:#?}", parsed);
        assert!(parsed.is_ok());

        match parsed {
            Ok(source_unit) => {
                let contracts = create_contracts(source_unit);
                let contract = contracts.first();
                assert!(contract.is_some());

                let flip_func_sig = get_func_sig("flip()".to_string());
                let mutated_contract = contract.unwrap().call(flip_func_sig.as_str()).0;

                let get_func_sig = get_func_sig("get()".to_string());
                let ret = mutated_contract.call(get_func_sig.as_str()).1;
                match ret.as_slice() {
                    [solidity::grammar::Expression::BoolLiteral(val)] => {
                        assert_eq!(*val, true);
                    }
                    _ => assert!(false, "Unexpected return value: {:?}", ret)
                }
                println!("Return value: {:?}", ret);
                
            },
            Err(e) => assert!(false, "Error: {:?}", e)
        }
    }
```

Run this command to confirm that our contract call indeed returns `true`:
```bash
cargo test test_call_flipper_contract_flip -- --nocapture
```

The output should be:
```bash
Return value: [BoolLiteral(true)]
test tests::test_call_flipper_contract_flip ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 5 filtered out; finished in 0.02s
```

And that is it for now! I hope this tutorial was educational and you have actually learned a thing or two about Solidity, EVM or Rust itself.
Next time we're going to revisit function arguments, calldata, constructors, getters and more.
